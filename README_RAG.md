# Enhanced Call Center AI with RAG System

## Overview

This enhanced call center AI system now includes a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) component that learns from your customer service chat data to provide:

- **Real-time agent assistance** with contextual suggestions
- **Historical case analysis** to find similar resolved issues
- **Performance analytics** based on conversation patterns
- **Automated issue categorization** and resolution templates
- **Sentiment-aware response recommendations**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up AWS Credentials

```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Or set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 3. Run the Demo

```bash
python demo_rag.py
```

## 📊 Data Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Preprocess Your Chat Data

```bash
python data/preprocess_data.py
```

This will:
- Clean and structure your conversation data
- Extract key patterns and categories
- Generate conversation summaries
- Create temporal analysis

### Step 2: Initialize the RAG System

```python
from src.aws_agent import AWSCallCenterAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = AWSCallCenterAgent()

# Build knowledge base from your data
await agent.initialize_knowledge_base("data/customer_service_chats.json")
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Call Analysis

```python
# Analyze a call with RAG insights
call_data = {
    'call_id': 'call_001',
    'transcription': "Customer complaint about billing charges...",
    'customer_id': 'cust_12345'
}

results = await agent.analyze_call_with_rag(call_data)

# Results include:
# - Traditional analysis (sentiment, summary, compliance)
# - Similar conversation matches
# - Resolution suggestions from past cases
# - Issue categorization
# - Category-specific insights
```

### 2. Real-time Agent Assistance

```python
# Get real-time assistance for agents
assistance = await agent.provide_agent_assistance(
    customer_message="I can't access my account",
    conversation_history=previous_messages,
    agent_id="agent_123"
)

# Returns:
# - Enhanced response suggestions
# - Similar resolved cases
# - Urgency level assessment
# - Recommended actions
# - Confidence scores
```

### 3. Performance Analytics

```python
# Generate performance insights
insights = await agent.generate_performance_insights(
    agent_id="agent_123",
    time_period="7d"
)

# Provides:
# - Resolution rates by category
# - Average handling times
# - Improvement recommendations
# - Trend analysis
```

## 🧠 RAG System Components

### 1. Conversation Indexing
- Semantic embeddings of all conversations
- FAISS vector database for fast similarity search
- Metadata tracking for resolution status and categories

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Issue categorization (billing, technical, account, etc.)
- Resolution template extraction
- Agent performance pattern analysis

### 3. Smart Suggestions
- Context-aware response recommendations
- Similar case retrieval
- Best practice suggestions based on successful resolutions

### 4. Performance Analytics
- Category-wise resolution rates
- Response time optimization
- Agent coaching recommendations

## 📈 Data Insights from Your Chat Data

Based on the analysis of your customer service chats, the system provides:

### Issue Categories Detected:
