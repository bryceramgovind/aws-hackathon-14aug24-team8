User: Hello Opus, can you please help make me some mock data? The data is for customer chats with customer service agent. THe customers are contacting because they have a query or a problem about their phone or mobile phone plans. They may have issues with roaming or they are going overseas, or they want to leave our service. They may also want to buy a new service.

The schema should be as follows:
contact_id: string = e.g. uuid
start_date: timestamp
end_date: timestamp
chat_id: string e.g. uuid
phone_number: string in Australia e.g. 0412345678
chat_user_id: string e.g. uuid
chat_text: string - the message from the customer or the customer service agent
chat_time_shift: int - how many seconds are we into the chat
chat_user_type: string - e.g. customer or agent (agent meaning the customer service agent)
message_number: int - what number message is this, e.g. 1. is the first message of the conversation

First can you help me design a prompt? I want at least 1000 conversations of mock data.
Model: I'll help you create a comprehensive prompt for generating mock customer service chat data. Here's a well-structured prompt that should give you diverse and realistic conversations:

## Prompt for Generating Mock Customer Service Chat Data

**Generate 1000 realistic customer service chat conversations for an Australian mobile phone company with the following specifications:**

### Schema Requirements:
- **contact_id**: UUID format (e.g., "a4b5c6d7-e8f9-1234-5678-90abcdef1234")
- **start_date**: ISO timestamp when chat began (between 2024-01-01 and 2024-03-31)
- **end_date**: ISO timestamp when chat ended (typically 5-30 minutes after start)
- **chat_id**: UUID format (unique for entire conversation)
- **phone_number**: Australian mobile format (04XXXXXXXX)
- **chat_user_id**: UUID format (same for customer throughout conversation, different for agent)
- **chat_text**: The actual message content
- **chat_time_shift**: Seconds elapsed since conversation start (0 for first message)
- **chat_user_type**: Either "customer" or "agent"
- **message_number**: Sequential message number (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Conversation Topics Distribution:
1. **Billing Issues (25%)**: Wrong charges, payment problems, plan confusion
2. **International Roaming (20%)**: Activating roaming, rates, overseas travel setup
3. **Service Cancellation (15%)**: Wanting to leave, retention attempts
4. **Technical Issues (15%)**: No signal, slow data, phone problems
5. **Plan Changes (15%)**: Upgrading, downgrading, adding services
6. **New Services (10%)**: Inquiring about new plans, add-ons, devices

### Conversation Characteristics:
- **Length**: 6-20 messages per conversation
- **Timing**: 
  - Customer messages: 15-60 seconds between messages
  - Agent messages: 30-90 seconds between messages
- **Agent behavior**: Professional, empathetic, solution-focused
- **Customer emotions**: Vary between frustrated, confused, neutral, happy
- **Resolution rate**: 80% resolved, 20% escalated or unresolved

### Realistic Elements to Include:
- Typos and casual language from customers
- Professional but friendly language from agents
- Natural conversation flow with greetings and closings
- Realistic wait times between messages
- Common Australian expressions and spellings
- Reference to actual mobile plan types (prepaid, postpaid, data packs)
- Mention of real scenarios (going to Bali, visiting family overseas, moving house)

### Data Formatting:
Output as JSON array where each object represents one message row, ordered by contact_id and message_number.

### Example Conversation Pattern:
